"Import/export is a new feature that allows you to transfer forms, fields, field options, styles and everything else saved by the plugin between Wordpress installations. Clicking the Export All button will create a .SQL file for download. With the .SQL export file you can use the importer within the CCF plugin admin page to import the .SQL file. The built-in importer is completely safe as long as you only import files that have been generated by the CCF exporter. \n"
"                            You can also use PHPMyAdmin or any other MySQL database administration tool to run the import file. Importing a .SQL file will never overwrite any existing data. \n"
"                            It is strongly recommended that you import CCF .SQL files using the built-in importer with in the admin panel due to the added complexity of importing using alterative methods.\n"
"                            If you are importing without using the built-in importer (such as PHPMyAdmin), then note the following: You should only run the import file on Wordpress installations that already have CCF PGP installed; also you will need to change the table prefix for each query within the .SQL file."
